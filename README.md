# Super-Shopping-Site-
This is a shopping site that allows a user search for a product. User can add items to cart and see price of each item no matter the quantity. The user can also remove items from cart and toggle between light and dark mode

My api does not have a key that is why the hide key code is commented out and the process of creating .env was just for familiarization
